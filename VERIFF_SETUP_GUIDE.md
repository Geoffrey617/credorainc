# Veriff ID Verification Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Veriff ID verification for landlord verification in your Credora application.

## üéØ Overview

Veriff provides enterprise-grade identity verification with:
- Government ID verification from 190+ countries
- Selfie verification with advanced liveness detection
- Document authenticity checks with AI-powered fraud detection
- Real-time decision engine
- Compliance with global KYC/AML regulations

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **Veriff Account**: Sign up at [veriff.com](https://www.veriff.com)
2. **API Keys**: Get your API and Secret keys from Veriff dashboard
3. **Webhook Configuration**: Set up webhook endpoint for real-time updates

## üîß Step 1: Veriff Account Setup

### 1.1 Create Account
1. Go to [veriff.com](https://www.veriff.com)
2. Sign up for a business account
3. Complete your business verification
4. Access the Veriff Station dashboard

### 1.2 Get API Keys
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **API Keys** in Veriff Station
2. Copy your **API Key** (public key)
3. Copy your **Secret Key** (private key for webhooks)
4. Note your **Base URL** (usually `https://stationapi.veriff.com`)

### 1.3 Configure Verification Flow
1. Go to **Integrations** in the dashboard
2. Configure verification features:
   - **Document Verification**: Enable ID document capture
   - **Selfie Verification**: Enable with liveness detection
   - **Biometric Matching**: Enable face matching
3. Set supported document types and countries
4. Configure decision logic and manual review settings

## üîß Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with your Veriff credentials:

```bash
# Veriff ID Verification
VERIFF_API_KEY=your_veriff_api_key_here
VERIFF_SECRET_KEY=your_veriff_secret_key_here
VERIFF_BASE_URL=https://stationapi.veriff.com
```

### Environment Variables Explained:
- **VERIFF_API_KEY**: Your Veriff API key (public key for session creation)
- **VERIFF_SECRET_KEY**: Your Veriff secret key (for webhook signature verification)
- **VERIFF_BASE_URL**: Veriff API endpoint (usually the same for all accounts)

## üîß Step 3: Database Setup

Run the SQL schema to add/update verification fields:

```bash
# Execute the SQL file in your Supabase dashboard
psql -h your-supabase-host -U postgres -d postgres -f add-veriff-verification-fields.sql
```

Or copy and paste the contents of `add-veriff-verification-fields.sql` into your Supabase SQL editor.

## üîß Step 4: Configure Webhooks

### 4.1 Set Webhook URL
1. In Veriff Station, go to **Settings** > **Webhooks**
2. Add webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/veriff/webhook`
3. Select events to listen for:
   - `verification.decision.approved`
   - `verification.decision.declined`
   - `verification.decision.review`
   - `verification.decision.resubmission_requested`

### 4.2 Webhook Security
- Veriff automatically signs webhooks with your secret key
- Our webhook endpoint verifies signatures using HMAC-SHA256
- No additional configuration needed

## üîß Step 5: Testing

### 5.1 Sandbox Testing
1. Use test API keys for development
2. Veriff provides test documents for different scenarios
3. Test various verification outcomes

### 5.2 Production Testing
1. Switch to live API keys
2. Test with real documents (your own)
3. Verify webhook delivery and signature verification

## üéØ How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **Landlord Registration**: User signs up as landlord
2. **ID Verification Prompt**: Redirected to verification page
3. **Veriff SDK**: Loads verification interface in iframe
4. **Document Capture**: User takes photos of ID and selfie
5. **Real-time Processing**: Veriff processes verification
6. **Webhook Notification**: Result sent to your webhook endpoint
7. **Database Update**: Verification status updated
8. **Dashboard Access**: Landlord gains full access

### API Flow:
```
1. Frontend calls /api/veriff/create-session
2. Backend creates Veriff session
3. Frontend loads Veriff iframe
4. User completes verification
5. Veriff sends webhook to /api/veriff/webhook
6. Backend updates landlord verification status
7. Frontend receives completion callback
```

| `not_started` | Verification not yet initiated |
| `pending` | Verification submitted, under review |
| `approved` | Successfully verified |
| `declined` | Verification failed |
